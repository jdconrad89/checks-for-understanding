## Week One - Module 3 Recap

Fork this respository. Answer the questions to the best of your ability. Try to answer them with limited amount of external research. These questions cover the majority of what we've learned this week (which is a TON!). 

Note: When you're done, submit a PR. 

1. What is `json` and why is it important?
  Json stands for "JavaScript Object Notation" one reason it's imporant is because it's a form of data output that is both easy   for computers and users to read.
2. What's the difference between `joins` and `includes` in ActiveRecord?
  (referencing rales engine) includes would make more sense if you wanted to find all the customer names of people who bought     something from a given merchant where a joins table would make more sense if you just wanted to find mercahnts who had more     than 20 customers but you don't care about the customer's names.  
3. What's an API?
  Application Protocol Inteface, tells an software should interact. 
4. How do we test an internal API (in general)?
  By testing the Json output in localhost and testing the ouput/endpoints in our test files.
5. What are two different ways to customize your `json`?
  Jbuilder and serializer
